# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
My learning work using the ["Deep Learning avec TensorFlow"](https://www.dunod.com/sciences-techniques/deep-learning-avec-tensorflow-mise-en-oeuvre-et-cas-concrets) book (Aurélien Géron)

## What is done in this repository ?
All what i didn't knowed before buy this book, it mean:

- Normal Equation for linear regression
- Batch Gradient Descent for linear regression

## What i have already done before buy the book
So, i don't code these algorithms:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Learning Shedule
- Logistic Gradient Descent
